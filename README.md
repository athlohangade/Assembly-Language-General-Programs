# Assembly-Language-General-Programs
<ul>
    <li>
        Various programs like <b>fibonacci, factorial, matrix operation, string
        manipulation</b>, etc. are implemented in assembly language using TASM.
    <li>
        The name of each file in the repo defines the program.<br>
        The user can open the file and read the first commented line to 
        determine what the program does.
    <li>
        To run the programs, install <b>DOSBOX</b> and <b>TASM</b> on your pc.
        You can find easily on google how to install them.
</ul>
<h3> Running the programs :</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        After installing DOSBOX and TASM, in the DOS prompt, type <i>'tasm filename'</i>
        to convert the source program into an <b>object file</b>.
    <li>
        Then type <i>'tlink filename'</i>. This command uses linker TLINK to 
        link files together into an <b>executable file</b> 'filename.exe'.
    <li>
        Execute the file by typing the <i>'filename'</i>. The program get
        executed and the output is displayed on DOS prompt.
    <li>
        You can edit the file in any editor but save the file using the
        extension <b>.asm</b>.
